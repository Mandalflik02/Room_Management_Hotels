# Room_Management_Hotels
A system that helps hotel employees monitor the condition of the rooms in several categories: 
    1) Occupancy status
    2) Daily cleaning mode
    3) Faults
    4) Charges that guests have in the room
    5) Vacation type (accommodation only / half board / full board / customized)
    
1. Occupancy status: The system will show if the room is occupied or not and you will see how many people are staying in the room
2. Daily cleaning mode: The system will show the user if the room has been cleaned today or needs to be cleaned
3. Faults: If there are faults in the room the system will do a number of things 1) Every morning it will alert about the room to remind the user that the room needs to be repaired
2) The system will mark the room so that it will not be possible to let guests in
4. Charges for guests: If guests in the room decide to pay for services available at the hotel through the option of payment at the end of the stay, the system will add an alert to the day of their departure to request payment of the total amount accrued to them during their stay.
5. Type of holiday: The system will show the relevant users (dining room staff, pool buffet staff, etc.) the type of holiday of the guests in order to know if they have to pay for the service they are requesting or are entitled to it by virtue of their type of holiday.


Screen types:
1. Rooms:
A list of rooms arranged by type and next to each is listed if available
2. Calendar:
A calendar will be displayed where future invitations can be viewed, as well as add invitations
3. Check out:
You can register a room name / customer name and it will be possible to "remove it from the system"
4. Check-in:
If there is a reservation in advance then there will be a screen only of confirmation of arrival, if there is no reservation then it will be possible to check the availability of rooms for the dates the customer requests and then add it to the system
5. Settings:
Information about the user who is currently logged in, and settings of the system itself such as language (in the future), text size and the like.


important points:
• Build a system in English (below add an option for additional languages)
• Create an easy-to-use system
• Give access to information about a room / customer according to the type of user (receptionist / cleaner / entrance hall worker / pool buffet worker / manager)
• Learn to create a DATABASE that will contain all the information
• Create a dummy hotel (build all the information about it + a logo for the design) in order to check that the whole system works
